Oct 8 – Rosen-Metsch – Regarding the attacks in Israel


Dear Columbia GS Students,


I watched the terrible deadly terrorist acts of this weekend in Israel with great sadness, knowing how directly this impacts our GS community and the many students, alumni, family members, and friends from and in Israel. My heart and thoughts are with you; we are here to support you however possible. Please know that we are in close contact with our colleagues and students studying in Tel Aviv as part of our Dual Degree Program with Tel Aviv University (TAU). We will continue to monitor the situation and work closely with our colleagues and students at TAU.


I have been hearing from several GS students who have been directly affected by the events in Israel this weekend, including some students who are reservists in the IDF. Your advisors and the GS Wellbeing team are here to work with you and with the faculty and our administration to support you.


I know this is an extremely difficult time for many in our community. If you need support, please reach out to gshealthandwellness@columbia.edu to set up a time to meet. You can also be in touch with Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office of the University Chaplain, and the Kraft Center – if you need help connecting, please let us know.


Our hearts and prayers are with those targeted by these brutal acts of terror. Please know that we are here for you at Columbia GS.


In community,


Lisa Rosen-Metsch
Dean
