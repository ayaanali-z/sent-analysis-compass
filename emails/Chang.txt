Oct 9 – Chang – Regarding the escalating crisis in Israel


Dear Students,
 
Following the deadly attacks on Israel and escalating violence, I write to express my support and sympathy during this time of great loss, fear, and sadness to our students who are affected by this horrific situation. 
 
I know that many of you are feeling distress at this time. Please know that we are here to support you however possible. In addition to your CSA and Departmental advisors, you may also want to connect with staff in Residential Life. Support is also available through Columbia’s  Counseling and Psychological Services, University Health Services, Columbia Religious Life, the Office of the University Chaplain, or the International Students and Scholars Office.
 
Students currently abroad may call International SOS and ask to speak to an Enhanced Emotional Support Counselor at (215) 942-8478.
You may also reach out directly to our Senior Associate Dean of Engineering Student Affairs Jenny Mak at jenny@columbia.edu.  
We understand that during this tumultuous time, you may be in need of extra support. Our faculty and staff are ready to offer assistance where needed, so please do not hesitate to ask for any support you need.
Let’s stand in community as best we can during this difficult time.
Sincerely,
Shih-Fu Chang
Dean of Columbia Engineering

Nov 8 – Chang – Student support


Dear Columbia Engineering Students, 


I hope that you all have had some time over the academic break for some much-needed rest and relaxation. As we resume classes, I’d like to share a brief review of the resources and support available to you at Columbia. We are aware that many of you are navigating challenging situations, emotions, and circumstances, and I want to reassure you that we are all here for you. Some members of our community have been directly impacted by the terrorist attacks on Israel and ensuing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and others have been affected here on campus by incidents following these events.   


On October 27, President Shafik issued a statement condemning antisemitic incidents on campus, and incidents of harassment and intimidation against Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab students. At Columbia we do not tolerate hate speech or violence in any form. Each of these incidents is being investigated and treated with utmost seriousness, and disciplinary action is in progress in accordance with University policies. Following this statement, President Shafik joined the Presidents of Barnard College and Teachers College in announcing a new task force on antisemitism and a resource group with Barnard to support targets of doxing. These initiatives will further expand the University’s ability to readily take important actions toward maintaining a safe and inclusive environment on campus.  


No program or policy can undo the harm of racism and bigotry, but we are committed to supporting students and ensuring their safety and well-being in every way possible. We will continue to provide any form of support needed, including academic and mental health support, and are committed to continue fostering an open environment for free and inclusive discussion and reasoned inquiry that upholds respect, trust, civility, and safety. 


Specific actions and support resources include:


* A CC-SEAS Joint Campus Climate Response Team addressing students' needs in real time;
* A resource page of University resources available for students, faculty, and staff impacted by these events;
* Departments and individual faculty members are proactively working with impacted students on flexible accommodations, in-major tutoring, and academic supports that minimize interruptions to their learning;
* Staff, including those in Residential Life, Religious Life, Counseling and Psychological Services, Career Placement and Student Affairs, are available to meet with students one-on-one and in groups to address needs and concerns related to this situation and more broadly;
* Expanded school-wide educational opportunities for all interested students to engage with challenging and complex topics and address issues of well-being that arise from such engagements, including those through our Professional Development & Leadership program, Engineering Wellness, and other campus communities.
* Programs and initiatives, within the engineering school or with partners across Columbia, to support further discussion of these complex topics.


If you have any questions, please contact cc-seas@columbia.edu.  


While the University is acting to address egregious violations involving hate speech and intimidation, I know that the vast majority of our students and other members of the Engineering family are engaged in peaceful discussions, and are helping and supporting each other in admirable ways. I am very grateful for the strong sense of community and inclusiveness at Columbia Engineering, and for your commitment to our shared values and our shared humanity. 


Sincerely,
