Oct 9 – Frazier (nursing) – Message of Support About the War in the Middle East

Dear Columbia Nursing Community,
I write you today feeling immense sadness and dismay regarding the devastating attacks in Israel and Gaza this weekend.

Sadly, there is every expectation that the conflict in the Middle East will continue to escalate. In times of tragedy, it is important that we come together as a community to support each other, that we honor and respect each other, and that we be as gentle as we can with each other.
As I so often say, nursing is, at its core, about caring. Let us all care for each other, as individuals and as a community, so that we can maintain the resilience to care for our patients.
